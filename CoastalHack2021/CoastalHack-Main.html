		<h1>Food Rush</h1>
		<p>This game was made for the Coastal Hacks Hackathon. The theme of the hackathon was Wellness. 
			The point of this wacky shopping simulator is to balance eating healthy and unhealthy. 
			Eating unhealthy food makes you hyper which gives you a speed bonus and allows you to 
			jump over the shelves, but beware! If you eat too much junk food you will get a sugar crash, 
			slowing you down to a crawl.<br>
			To play the game you use the arrow keys to move to grab the healthy food. Healthy foods 
			increase your score while unhealthy food decreases it. Grab as much food as you can in 
			the given time. <br>
			Erik Leclercq, Ojan Hodjat, Linus Gäddnäs and Joel Nylund.<br>
